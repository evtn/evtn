I'm 20, I'm a person, living in cold and snowy Siberia. Someday I want to move to Estonia.
Here's some random facts about me:

* Writing Python code for 4 years (since early 2018).
* Previous point doesn't mean I want to use Django. Never ever.
* Sometimes I use JavaScript/TypeScript (at work, for example), mostly with React
* Interested in math, languages, graphics and many more things. Doesn't mean I'm good at those, though.
* I'm a fan of Linux, though I'm fine with Windows, using both.
