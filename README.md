# Very funny heading (previous was not funny, yes)

I'm 21, I'm a person, living in ~~cold and snowy Siberia~~ Tbilisi, Georgia.    
Here's some random facts about me:

* Writing Python code since 2018.
* Previous point doesn't mean I want to use Django. Never ever.
* Sometimes I use JavaScript/TypeScript (at work, for example), mostly with React
* Interested in math, languages, graphics and many more things. Doesn't mean I'm good at those, though.
